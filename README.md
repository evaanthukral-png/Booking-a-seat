🚂 Seat Booking System
A simple C program that simulates booking seats in a any 8x5 place.
This project helped me practice 2D arrays, loops, and basic logic building in C.

✨ Features
Book seats row by row (8 rows × 5 seats = 40 seats).
Prevents overbooking (tells you if not enough seats are available).
Shows seat number (row + seat) when booked.
Detects when the place is fully booked.
